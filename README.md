# CPSC-3220---Programming-Languages-and-Translation--Project1

Simple Functions, Lists and Vectors, & Maps
Utilizing Visual Studio Code, Clojure, Calva, & REPL

Instructions:
• Complete all of the following problems.
• Use the supplied unit tests to test your solutions.
• Do not include error checking (assume argument types are correct, for example).
• When you are asked to write a function, you may write additional functions that help you simplify the problem.
• Do not use def or defn inside of functions. These define global variables and using them inside a function
indicates a misunderstanding of proper functional programming.
• Do not use any of the built-in Clojure functions/macros except: def, defn, fn, if, cond, let, arithmetic operations,
comparison operations, and, or, not, str, conj, cons, first, rest, nth, zero?, empty?, nil?, odd?, even?,
assoc
• Submit your solution on Canvas as a single .tar.gz or .zip file containing your entire project folder.
